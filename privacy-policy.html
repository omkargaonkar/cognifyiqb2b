					personally identifiable information, both during transmission and while stored on our systems.
					Encryption ensures that your data is unreadable to unauthorized parties.</p>

				<h3>Access Controls</h3>

					duties. We enforce strong access controls to ensure that only those with the appropriate permissions
					can access your sensitive information.</p>

				<h3>Security Protocols</h3>
				<p>We adopt industry-standard security protocols, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
					secure network configurations, to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats. Regular
					security audits are conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.</p>

				<p>While we take reasonable precautions to protect your data, please note that no system is completely
					secure. We recommend that you take additional steps to protect your personal information, such as
					using strong passwords and keeping your account information private.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
				<p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected,
					including business purposes and legal obligations. Once the data is no longer needed, we take
					appropriate measures to securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

				<h3>Retention for Business Purposes</h3>
				<p>We retain personal data for as long as it is required to provide our services, manage accounts,
					process transactions, or fulfill other legitimate business purposes.</p>

				<h3>Retention for Legal Compliance</h3>

					applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations. This may include compliance with tax,
					financial reporting, or legal retention requirements.</p>

				<h3>Secure Deletion or Anonymization</h3>
				<p>Once the retention period has expired, we take steps to either securely delete your personal data or
					anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. These measures help protect your privacy and
					ensure that your data is not used beyond its intended purpose.</p>

				<p>If you have any questions about our data retention practices or would like to request the deletion of
					your personal data, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy.</p>

			<section>
				<h2>8. Data Subject Rights</h2>
				<p>As a data subject, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These rights are designed to
					give you greater control over how your data is collected, used, and shared. Below are the key rights
					you have under applicable privacy laws:</p>

				<h3>Right to Access</h3>
				<p>You have the right to request copies of the personal data we hold about you. This allows you to
					confirm whether we are processing your data and to obtain information about how it is being used.
				</p>

				<h3>Right to Rectification</h3>
				<p>If you believe the personal data we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to
					request corrections. We will take reasonable steps to rectify any inaccuracies in your data.</p>

				<h3>Right to Erasure</h3>
				<p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data in certain circumstances. This

					when it is no longer needed for its original purpose or when you withdraw consent for its use.</p>

					example, if you contest the accuracy of the data, you may request that its processing be limited
					until we verify its accuracy.</p>

					format, allowing you to transfer it to another service. This helps ensure that your data can be

				<h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
				<p>In the course of providing our services, your personal data may be transferred across borders,
					particularly if our company operates in multiple countries. These transfers may involve countries
					outside your home country, including those outside the European Economic Area (EEA), such as the
					United States.</p>

				<p>When personal data is transferred to countries outside the EEA, we ensure that appropriate safeguards
					are in place to protect your data. These safeguards may include:</p>

				<h3>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</h3>
				<p>We may use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), which are legal agreements that ensure personal data
					is protected when transferred to countries outside the EEA. SCCs impose specific obligations on data
					recipients to maintain a high level of data protection.</p>

				<h3>Privacy Shield Framework</h3>
				<p>In some cases, transfers to countries like the United States may be subject to the Privacy Shield
					framework, which requires companies to uphold data protection standards comparable to those of the
					EEA. This framework provides assurances that your data will be handled in accordance with data
					protection principles.</p>

				<p>We are committed to ensuring that any international transfers of personal data comply with applicable
					data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you have any

					<h2>14. What is GDPR?</h2>
					<p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation established by the European Union (EU)

						individuals greater control over their personal data while holding businesses accountable for
						how they collect, process, and store this data.</p>

					<p>The GDPR applies to any organization that processes the personal data of individuals residing in
						the EU, regardless of where the organization is located. It imposes strict requirements on
						businesses to ensure transparency, security, and accountability in data handling practices.</p>

					<p>Key principles of GDPR include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Businesses must clearly inform individuals about how their
							data is collected, processed, and used.</li>
						<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Organizations must be able to demonstrate compliance with
							GDPR requirements.</li>
						<li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Personal data collected should be limited to what is
							necessary for the intended purpose.</li>
						<li><strong>Data Subject Rights:</strong> Individuals have the right to access, rectify, erase,
							or restrict the processing of their data.</li>
						<li><strong>Security:</strong> Organizations must implement appropriate security measures to
							protect personal data.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Failure to comply with GDPR can result in significant penalties, including fines of up to 4% of
						an organization's global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher.</p>

					<p>If you are located in the EU and have questions about how we handle your personal data under
						GDPR, please contact us for more information.</p>
